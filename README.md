  ## 1. Objective <a id=section1></a>

In this react project I have used JSX to build Monster Rolodex. In this project I have used class based components. In this project I have implemented Searching functionality with attractive card UI to display dynamic data. Search button is there to filter data as per your word typing.

To run this project you have to following libraries provided in section 2.

## 2. Importing Packages  <a id=section2></a>

To build the UI, and display data I have used 3rd party api to fetch the data and similarly as per data availability got images from 3rd party website. I have used "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" to get users data and to get the images I have used "https://robohash.org/${id}?set=set2&size=180x180" API. If you add numbers like 1, 2, 3 instead of ${id} in the above link you will get new image with 180x180 pixcel size.
You can change its image size as per your need.
I also added "Bigelow Rules" font from "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bigelow+Rules?query=bigel#standard-styles" this link for its title.

To run this project you have to follow following steps,

1. Clone the repository (git clone "repository name"),
2. Install npm (npm install),
3. npm start

After these command you will see in a browser that there is a new tab in which your project will run (http://localhost:3000);


## 3. UI view for Desktop <a id=section3></a>
